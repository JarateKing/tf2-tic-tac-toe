# TF2 Tic Tac Toe

Older script I wrote that runs a 2-player game of tic-tac-toe in the console. This is not actively being maintained or worked on, but I wanted a record of it so I don't have to go searching for it every time I reference it.

This was written by hand back in 2014 or so. I believe was posted on teamfortress.tv at one point, but was mostly distributed as an easter egg within MagnumHUD. The logic is sound, but I wouldn't be surprised if there's some minor bug at some point.

## Usage

### Installing

Put the `cfg/tictactoe` folder into tf2's `cfg` folder

### Running

Run `exec tictactoe/main.cfg`
