# TF2 Tic Tac Toe

Older script I wrote that runs a 2-player game of tic-tac-toe in the console. This is not actively being maintained or worked on, but I wanted a record of it so I don't have to go searching for it every time I reference it.

## Usage

### Installing

Put the `cfg/tictactoe` folder into tf2's `cfg` folder

### Running

Run `exec tictactoe/main.cfg`
